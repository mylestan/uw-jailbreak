		<p class="q-title">What is a Jailbreak Hitchhike?</p>
	</div>
	<p class="q-answer">The goal of a Jailbreak Hitchhike is simple. Participants create a team with which they'll raise money and travel. The team collects donations and makes bets before the event as part of the money-raising process. On the event day, all the teams gather at one location to start the race. Once the horn blows, teams have 36 hours to get as far from the University as possible, the only restriction being that they cannot use their own money to fund any part of the voyage. After 36 hours, teams come home and funding starts to be tallied up based on performance. Prizes are awarded for various things, but we think the journey is the ultimate reward.</p>

		<p class="q-title">Where did this originate?</p>
	</div>
	<p class="q-answer">Well...We saw all the hype about <a href="http://www.warwicksu.com/societies/jailbreak/">Warwick's</a> previous Jailbreak event, and were blown away. Hopefully they can shed more light on the event as time passes. All we know is that it's awesome, and we want to do it.</p>

		<p class="q-title">How does this event raise money for charity?</p>
	</div>
	<p class="q-answer">The same way any other fundraiders raises money! Participants sign up for the event and gather donations on their behalf - kind of like people sponsoring you to do something, but for a good cause. What makes jailbreak so cool is the opporunity for perfromance-based sponsorship; that is, can you get people to give money based on how well do you? We can't think of anything better. To give you an idea, a recent Jailbreak in Europ raised just over <a href="http://theboar.org/news/2010/nov/21/jailbreak-shatters-fundraising-target/">&pound;27,000 for charity</a> - incredible!</p>

		<p class="q-title">How do people get back?</p>
	</div>
	<p class="q-answer">They say the journey is the destination. Well, once you're at your 'destination', you're new destination is home, and that's a whole new journey! Getting back is completely in your hands - make sure you have enough cash or sponsors to bring you home! That being said, if you've slick-talked your way to anywhere impressive, you might want to think about slick-talking your way back.</p>

		<p class="q-title">What if I don't want to go all the way to Argentina?</p>
	</div>
	<p class="q-answer">Many people see the opportunity to travel to somewhere completely unknown as very exciting. Others...not so much. If you're not THAT crazy, set a more specific goal for yourself, that lets you limit your travel distance, and stay within your comfort zone. It's your trip, do with it as you please!</p>

		<p class="q-title">Why should I participate in this event?</p>
	</div>
	<p class="q-answer">Not only is this event an amazing fundraiser which tends to pull great amounts from people who don't actually think you'd get anywhere, it's also a rare excuse for you to shamelessly travel as far as possible, as adventurously as possible, for as cheap as possible. For many people, this very well could be the best experience of their university life!</p>
