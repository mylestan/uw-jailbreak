		<p class="q-title">What is a Jailbreak Hitchhike?</p>
	</div>
	<p class="q-answer">The goal of a Jailbreak Hitchhike is simple. Participants create a team with which they'll raise money and travel. The team collects donations and makes bets before the event as part of the money-raising process. On the event day, all the teams gather at one location to start the race. Once the horn blows, teams have 36 hours to get as far from the University as possible, the only restriction being that they cannot use their own money to fund any part of the voyage. After 36 hours, teams come home and funding starts to be tallied up based on performance. Prizes are awarded for various things, but we think the journey is the ultimate reward.</p>
