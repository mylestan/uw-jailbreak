		<p>First, you'll need to gather a team of 2 to 5 people. Each particpant needs to be a student here at uWaterloo and above 18.</p>
		<p>Things you'll need:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Passport &amp; Student ID</li>
			<li>Credit Card</li>
			<li>Proof of Insurance</li>
			<li>Cell Phone</li>
			<li>Registration Fee: $20/person</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Things we'll provide you with:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sweet and Obnoxiously-Bright T-Shirt</li>
			<li>Some Reb-Bull and Clif Bars to go</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once you've registered your team and are are all OK to go, it's time to start raising money and prepping for the big day.</p>

		<p>It sometimes can be hard to remember that this incredibly awesome experience is still a charity fundraiser! Teams are encouraged to collect donations on on behalf of their team before the event. We'll have downloadable forms you can use to keep track of donations, and printable blurbs about the event, the charity, and what you're about to do.</p>
		<p>Given the nature of the event, it's fun to raise the stakes a little bit and put some pride on the line. For example:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Friends think you'll fail? Commit them to $5 if you make it out of town, $20 if you're out of the province, $50 if you leave the great white north...you get the idea. Haggling is encouraged.</li>
			<li>Get sponsored by-the-kilometer. Hold them to x$/100km (good one for the family), and hope you find your way to a plane.</li>
			<li>Gather cash along the way. Not everyone will be willing to help you go, but most people will throw a few dollars for a good cause.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>3...2...1...Jailbreak!</p>
		<p>When the horn goes off at 9:00am, you and your team have 36 hours to get as far from the University campus as possible. Barring, you know, actual laws, the only rule is that you cannot spend any of your own money. This means collecting money and favors as you go is your only chance of getting away. Sweet-talk your way onto a bus (keep it legal, son), hitch a ride with a firendly stranger, or gather enough change to get yourself onto a plane (it's possible). Check in with us occassionaly to keep us up to date and to show off to your rivals/friends.</p>
		<p>Don't forget, the journey is the destination: this is probably one of the most exciting trips you'll ever do. Have a blast, and make the most of it!</p>
