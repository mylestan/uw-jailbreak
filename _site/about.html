	<div class="accordian-body">
		<p>Collect prayers and good-lucks in the form of donations. Some ways to raise the stakes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Friends think you'll fail? Commit them to $5 if you make it out of town, $20 if you're out of the province, $50 if you leave the great white north...you get the idea. Haggling is encouraged.</li>
			<li>Get sponsored by-the-kilometer. Hold them to x$/100km (good one for the family), and hope you find your way to a plane.</li>
			<li>Gather cash along the way. Not everyone will be willing to help you go, but most people will throw a few dollars for a good cause.</li>

	<div class="accordian-body">
		<p>"The time in 9:00am. Where will you be by 9:00pm tomorrow?" Use your charm, wit, and ingenuity to get as far from campus as physically possible. Sweet-talk your way onto a bus (keep it legal, son), or gather enough change to get yourself onto a plane (it's possible). Remember, the further you go, the more $ you get for charity. Don't forget, this is probably one of the most exciting trips you'll ever do. Make the most of it!</p>
