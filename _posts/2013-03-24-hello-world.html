<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by and checking the site out!  If you know what a jailbreak is, then awesome - jump onboard via Facebook and we'll keep you in the loop. If not - feel free to browse this (still-under-construction) website, which will hopefully give you a better idea of what it's all about. I'd also encourage you to read about the hype Jailbreak fundraisers have been generating in <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=quite+the+journey+is+the&aq=f&oq=quite+the+journey+is+the&aqs=chrome.0.57j62l3.2938&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=warwick+charity+jailbreak&oq=warwick+charity+jailbreak&gs_l=serp.3...661170.665735.1.665818.31.23.2.5.7.0.118.1251.20j3.23.0...1.0...1c.1.7.psy-ab.8hwZt8EEvGA&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm=bv.44158598,d.bmk&fp=1d1a2eb54f60d8af&biw=1276&bih=670" target="_blank">Europe</a> - and why it's high time we brought it to Canada!</p>
