<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>As the plans for the event start to move along, we're now looking for some awesome and dedicated people who would like to part of the core organizing/development team. This means you'll be reponsible for a chunk of the planning and execution of this program, and will be working with the rest of the team to get it done. The event date is tentatively set for early Fall Term 2013, so we'll be working in-person and via satellite over the summer to pull it all together.</p>
<p>There's a wide range of things to be done, but the main areas are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sponsor/Business Development</li>
	<li>Social Media Management</li>
	<li>Advertizing</li>
	<li>Web Development</li>
	<li>Mobile Development</li>
	<li>Legal Co-ordination</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these things fit your interests, please email us at <a href="mailto:uwjailbreak@gmail.com" target="_blank">uwjailbreak@gmail.com</a>, let us know what you're interested in, and provide a brief description of you're experience/background in that area. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
