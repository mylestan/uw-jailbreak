#UW Jailbreak

A mock site for a Jailbreak Charity Fundraiser at the Unviersity of Waterloo.

Inspired by recent events at the University of Warsick and their previous success with the event, I decided to take the opportunity to throw another website together, which would act as a starting point if we were to attempt at running the event at our home university. 

For me, this site was more practice with HTML/CSS, Jekyll, some JS, as well as my first intro to social APIs.
