<h2>Want to help?</h2>
<p>That's awesome! There's tons to do here, and we can always use an extra hand. Feel free to <a href="mailto:uwjailbreak@gmail.com?subject=Hi,%20I'd%20like%20to%20help%20out!" target="_blank">email us</a> at uwjailbreak@gmail.com, or send us a message on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/UW-Jailbreak/449622371783475" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. On top of the planning, organization, and admin stuff, we're particularly looking for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Someone to build out the site and tracking features</li>
	<li>Someone good with organizing sponsors</li>
	<li>Someone to tackle advertizing and graphic design</li>
</ul>
<p>If it sounds like something you're interested in, please get in touch! Finally, we'll need a few people on the days of the event to help with HQ setup, keeping track of the event activity, and so forth. You get to watch it all go down, which is pretty damn cool!</p>
